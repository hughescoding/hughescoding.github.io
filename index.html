<p>
    My name is Michael Hughes and I am building this website in UCF Coding Boot Camp. I am super excited to be learning full stack development. 
    I work in education, my current professional title is IT Director at The Jewish Academy of Orlando. I helped create and currently 
    manage our schools Maker Space.
    <br>
    <br>
    I teach students Design Thinking, Digital Citizenship, Lego EV3 robotics, 3d Design, and more. I 
    plan to use the skills I am developing in this course with students at our school and to pursue other professional and personal projects.
